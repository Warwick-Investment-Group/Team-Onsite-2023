## It depends...

## To answer this question, we must first ask ourselves a couple fundamental questions:

- What is the purpose of data in our organization?
- What is the purpose of the Data Science team?

## The Data Science team's purpose is to...

- **Create value** for the business by **leveraging data & analytics** to **make better decisions**. 

## Are we creating value?

## How do we know?

## How do we measure it?

## Service-oriented data teams are less effective.

- The submit a ticket with a specific question and get a specific answer model is not optimal.
  - This service model doesn't allow for the Data Science team to be proactive.
- What if we treated data as a product?

## Product minded teams are winning the market place.
- Centering the relationship between the product and the customer is the key to success.
- When we treat data as a product and our colleagues as customers, we can unlock the full potential of data science.

## Ok, what is the data product?
- The data product is the **data**, **analytics** and **tools** that are found in the organizations.
- A simple heuristic; Is this being used to make decisions?
  - If the answer is yes, then it is a data product.

## Data has limited value in its own silo.
- If integrated within the data product model, superlinear value can be created.
- The team's role expands to include guiding the strategy and features of the data product.
- Consequently, we can adopt best practices from product management.

## #1 Focus on the customer.
- A good product team will center the users and their experience with the product.
- This means that much of the day-to-day of product management is **coordination and communication** between different stakeholders.
- There is **outbound** communication of what is the vision and prioritization of the product, and **inbound** communication from users.
- This requires **empathy** and a deep understanding of the customer.

## Pro Tip: Communicate with your colleagues (users) proactively and hear their feedback!

## #2 Define Success
- Success is defined by the **impact** that the data product has on the business.
- Measured in the number and volume of decisions you’re enabling
- Measured by the quality of those decisions with respect to KPIs.
- It is not the number of products built,i.e. it’s not the output of the DS Team.

## Pro Tip: Define success in terms of the impact of the data product on the business.

## #3 Talk to everyone and document everything!
- Users Stories are a simple way to define how a new feature (dashboard, report, or metric) will provide value for the end user.
- The user story is a simple sentence that follows the format:
  - As a [user], I want to [action], so that [outcome].

## Pro Tip: Use user stories to help define scope. 

## #4 Prioritize ruthlessly.
- Prioritize based on the impact of the feature on the business.
- Impact can be measured by the number of users, the frequency of use, and the impact on KPIs.

## Pro Tip: Prioritize using the ICE framework.
- Impact: How much will this feature impact the business?
- Confidence: How confident are we can succeed?
- Ease of implementation: How easy is it to implement?

## Conclusion

- As we use this week to make strategic decisions about the future of our team, let's keep in mind that we are here to create value for the business. 

- We can use the product model to help us create more value for the business and our colleagues.
